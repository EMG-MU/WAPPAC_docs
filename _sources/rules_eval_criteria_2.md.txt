# Competition Rules & Evaluation Criteria

The **WavePiston Passive Control (WAPPAC)** Competition challenges participants to design an optimal **passive control system** for the WavePiston device, with the goal of maximizing its overall energy performance while strictly respecting the system‚Äôs physical and operational constraints.

---

## üéØ Objective

Participants must implement a control law that **maximizes the performance index** $\mathcal{G}$, which reflects the trade-off between captured power, device motion, and control effort.

$$
\max:  \mathcal{G}\left(F_u(t)\right)
$$

This objective function, along with all of its constituent terms ($\bar{P}_u$, $|x|_{98}$, $|F_u|_{98}$, and $|p_u|_{98}$), is fully defined in the **[Introduction](../)** and **[Quick Start Guide](../quick-start/)** tabs.

The maximization of $\mathcal{G}$ is performed under the **WavePiston dynamic model**, and the key passivity constraint:

$$
p_u(t) = F_u(t) \dot{x}(t) \ge 0
$$

must be satisfied throughout the entire simulation period.

## üåä Sea States and Evaluation Setup

The competition consists of **three deterministic sea-state scenarios** representing different energy levels:

| Sea State ID | Description     | Energy Level  |
|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| 1 | Mild Sea | Low energy |
| 2 | Mid Sea  | Intermediate energy |
| 3 | Harsh Sea | High energy |

Each controller must perform robustly across all three conditions.  
Participants‚Äô performance is evaluated **individually for each sea state** and **aggregated into a final score**.

---

## üß© Simulation Phases

Each simulation consists of two key periods:

### **1. Full Simulation Period (t ‚â• 0 s)**
- Your controller must be active from the very beginning of the simulation.
- The **passivity constraint** ($p_u(t) \ge 0$ W) must be satisfied at all times.
- Violations of this rule in any sea state result in **disqualification of that simulation** from scoring.

### **2. Scoring Period (t ‚â• 30 s)**
- The first 30 seconds are considered an **initial transient** phase.
- The performance index $\mathcal{G}$ and its associated terms are computed **only** during the scoring window.
- This ensures fairness and consistency across all control strategies.

For more details on simulation input configuration and file structure, refer to the **[Quick Start Guide](../quick-start/)** tab.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Evaluation Modes

Two simulation modes are available within the WAPPAC executable:

### **Development Mode (`eval_flag = false`)**
- Used for tuning and testing.
- Runs a single simulation for a chosen sea state and random or fixed wave realization.
- Produces detailed, human-readable outputs in the `sim_out/` folder (plots, `.json`, `.npz`).

### **Evaluation Mode (`eval_flag = true`)**
- Used to generate the official submission files.
- Automatically runs all **three sea states (1‚Äì3)** with fixed deterministic seeds.
- Produces encrypted output files in the `evaluation_outputs/` folder.
- Displays only pass/fail information for the passivity check; no performance metrics are revealed.

The use of **Evaluation Mode** ensures standardized, tamper-proof assessment.

---

## üìà Scoring Methodology

For each sea state, a performance index $\mathcal{G}$ is computed.  
The **final competition score** is the **mean of the three $\mathcal{G}$ values** obtained across the sea states:

$$
\mathcal{G}_{final} = \frac{1}{3} \sum_{i=1}^{3} \mathcal{G}_i
$$

where each $\mathcal{G}_i$ corresponds to sea state *i*.

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Constraints and Disqualification Rules

Participants must adhere strictly to the following physical and operational constraints during the **entire simulation period**:

| Constraint | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| $|x(t)| \le x_{max}$ | Sail displacement limit (2 m) |
| $|F_u(t)| \le F_{u,max}$ | Maximum control force (1 MN) |
| $p_u(t) \ge 0$ | Passivity constraint (no active power injection) |

Violating any of these constraints in any sea state will lead to **zero score** for that sea state.  
Persistent or severe violations may result in **disqualification from the competition**.

---

## üì§ Submission Requirements

To participate officially, you must submit via the [Submission Portal](../submission/):

1. **Encrypted Evaluation Files:**  
   All three `.enc` files generated by running your controller in Evaluation Mode.
2. **Controller Script (`my_controller.py`):**  
   The exact file used for your evaluation runs. Include any supporting modules if needed.
3. **Controller Report:**  
   A concise document describing your control approach, methodology, and key design choices.

All submitted items must be consistent and **reproducible** using the official WAPPAC simulator.

---

## üß† Integrity and Verification

To guarantee transparency and fairness:

- The **WAPPAC executable** ensures standardized hydrodynamic modeling and deterministic sea states.
- Controllers are executed in a **sandboxed environment**, preventing external interference or data manipulation.
- Final rankings are verified by **re-running all submissions** under the official setup to confirm identical encrypted outputs.

---

## üèÜ Final Ranking

Participants will be ranked according to their overall $\mathcal{G}_{final}$ value.  
In case of ties, secondary criteria (such as smoother control effort or numerical stability) may be considered.

---

**Summary:**
- The competition rewards controllers that **maximize $\mathcal{G}$** while maintaining strict **passivity** and **physical feasibility**.  
- All simulations are standardized, reproducible, and evaluated across **three sea states** of increasing energy.  
- Fairness and reproducibility are core to the WAPPAC competition‚Äôs design.
