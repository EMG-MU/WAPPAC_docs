# Summary: Evaluation Criteria & Competition Rules

To ensure a clear evaluation of the results, a crucial distinction between the full simulation time span and the scoring interval must be made.

```{important}
**Scoring Period (t ≥ 30s):**
The performance index ($\mathcal{G}$) is calculated **only** for the time window starting at **t = 30 seconds** until the end of the simulation run. This is done to mitigate the influence of initial system transients on the final score.
```

```{important}
**Full Simulation Period (t ≥ 0s):**
The controller proposed by the participants must be defined from the start of the siulation (t=0). 
The passivity constraint, $_{pto}(t) \ge 0$ W, must be satisfied for the **entire simulation duration** (t ≥ 0s). Any violation of this **fundamental rule** will result in **disqualification from the scoring** for that sea state.
```

```{important}
The performance index for the three sea states will be summed to compute the overall performance of the controller.
A list of merit will be made.
