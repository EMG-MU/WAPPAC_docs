# Summary of Evaluation Criteria & Competition Rules

To ensure a clear evaluation of the results, a crucial distinction between the full simulation time span and the scoring interval must be made.

```{important}
**Scoring Period (t ≥ 30s):**
The performance index $\mathcal{G}$ {eq}`eq-performance-index` is calculated **only** for the time window starting at **t = 30 seconds** until the end of the simulation run. This is done to mitigate the influence of initial system transients on the final score.
```

```{important}
**Full Simulation Period (t ≥ 0s):**
The controller proposed by the participants must be defined from the start of the siulation (t=0). 
The passivity constraint, $_{pto}(t) \ge 0$ W, must be satisfied for the **entire simulation duration** (t ≥ 0s). Any violation of this **fundamental rule** will result in **disqualification from the scoring** for that sea state.
```

```{important}
The performance index for the three sea states will be summed to compute the overall performance of the controller.
A list of merit will be made.
```

The performance index, also presented in the control problem formulation {doc}`model_control/control_problem`, is as follows:
```{math}
:label: eq-performance-index
\mathcal{G}\left(F_u(t)\right) = \frac{\bar{P}_u}{2 + \frac{|x(t)|_{98}}{x_{\max}} + \frac{|F_u(t)|_{98}}{F_{u,\max}} - \frac{\bar{P}_u}{|p_u(t)|_{98}} }
```

$$ s.t. \quad \text{WavePiston dynamics} $$
$$ \qquad\quad p_u(t) = F_u(t) \dot{x}(t) \ge 0  $$

where $\bar{P}_u$ is the average captured power **during the scoring period**, $|x(t)|_{98}$, $|F_u(t)|_{98}$, and $|p_u(t)|_{98}$ are the **98th percentiles** of the absolute sail displacement,  absolute control force, and instantaneous control power, respectively, **evaluated during the scoring period**. The simulated device motion obeys the Wavepiston dynamics and is subject to maximum allowable displacement $x_\mathrm{max}$ and force $F_{u,\max}$ constraints, in addition to the passivity constraint $p_u(t) \ge 0$, meaning that power extracted from the system cannot be negative
