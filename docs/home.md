## WAPPAC Competition

The WavePiston Passive Control (WAPPAC) competition is an open challenge offered to the wave energy and control community, where participants are invited to **design passive control strategies** for the novel WavePiston wave energy converter.
The goal is to **maximize captured energy while respecting WavePiston’s physical constraints**, with particular attention to the **PTO passivity constraint**, advancing the state of the art in wave energy control.

This competition is hosted by the **Centre for Ocean Energy Research (COER), Maynooth University**, and builds upon ongoing European research initiatives.

## WavePiston Device

[WavePiston](https://wavepiston.dk/) is a Danish wave energy technology developer, harnessing the power of ocean waves. Its system captures wave energy using a series of **sails and PTO units** coupled on a submerged pipe or 'string' (see {numref}`fig-wavepiston-1`). Each sail moves back and forth in response to the surge motion of passing waves and the horizontal motion of the sail relative to the string drives the hydraulic PTO unit, converting wave motion into usable energy.

## EU Horizon [SHY](https://shyproject.eu/) Project

WAPPAC is framed within the **EU Horizon Seawater HYdraulic (SHY) PTO project**, which develops key components of a seawater hydraulic PTO system and advanced control strategies for a novel wave energy converters.
The project aims to reduce the **levelized cost of energy (LCOE)** while minimizing environmental impact.

* **WavePiston**: Technology developer.
* **COER’s role**: Hydrodynamic modelling and control.
* **Key partners**: Technical University of Denmark, FibronPipe, Leser, Julia F. Chozas, Applied Renewables Research, Marine Systems Modelling, and PLOCAN.
