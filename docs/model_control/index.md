# WavePiston Model & Control Framework

This section describes the modeling framework of the WavePiston device, the formulation of the optimal control problem, its numerical implementation, and the shared model parametrization used in the competition. The aim is to provide participants with a consistent understanding of the physical system, control objectives, and computational setup.
