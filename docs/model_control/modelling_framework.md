# Modeling Framework

## WavePiston Device

[WavePiston](https://wavepiston.dk/) is an novel wave energy converter comprising multiple energy collectors mounted along a submerged string, as shown in {numref}`fig_wavepiston_mult_string`. Each collector consists of a sail that captures surge motion from incoming waves and a hydraulic power take-off (PTO) that converts this motion into usable energy.

For the purpose of WAPPAC competition, a simplified **one-sail, one-PTO** configuration is used, schematically represented in {numref}`fig_wavepiston_sch`. This abstraction sufficiently captures the key dynamics of the WavePiston device within the competition scope.

**WavePiston characteristics:**

* The device has **one degree of freedom (DoF)** along the surge direction.
* The sail **midpoint position** is at $x=0$, with incoming waves propagating along the positive $x$-axis ($\beta=0$).
* The **maximum allowable sail displacement** is denoted by $x_{\max}$.

**Up-wave Measurement:**

* A sensor measures the **up-wave** surface elevation at $x=-10$ m.

## WavePiston Dynamics

The hydrodynamics of the simplified WavePiston device can be described using **Cumminsâ€™ equation** with an additional viscous drag term {eq}`eq_WP_hydrodyn`:

```{math}
:label: eq_WP_hydrodyn
M \ddot{x}(t) + F_r(t) + \frac{1}{2} \rho A_{sail} C_D \, \dot{x} |\dot{x}|
= F_{ex}(t) - F_{pto}(t),
```

where:

* $x(t)$: sail position
* $\dot{x}(t)$: sail velocity
* $M = m_w + m_\infty$: total mass (device mass + added mass asymptote at infinite frequency)
* $F_{ex}(t)$: wave excitation force
* $F_{pto}(t)$: PTO control force
* $\rho$: seawater density
* $A$: sail area
* $C_D$: viscous drag coefficient

The radiation force $F_r(t)$ is approximated using a finite-order state-space model:

```{math}
\dot{\mathbf{\xi}}(t) &= \mathbf{A_r}\,\mathbf{\xi}(t) + \mathbf{B_r}\,\dot{x}(t) \\
F_r(t) &= \mathbf{C_r}\,\mathbf{\xi}(t)
```

where $\mathbf{\xi}(t)$ is the radiation state vector.

**Note:** **No hydrodynamic restoring force** acts on the WEC because the sails are constrained to move horizontally and are considered rigid. Therefore, this term is omitted from the hydrodynamic equation {eq}`eq_WP_hydrodyn`.

## PTO Passivity Constraint

Due to the WavePiston design, the PTO can only **extract power from the waves** and cannot inject power back into the system. Consequently, the PTO power is constrained to be non-negative at all times:

```{math}
p_{pto}(t) = F_{pto}(t) \dot{x}(t) \ge 0 \; \forall t
```

This **passivity constraint** introduces a nonlinear constraint on the control strategies and is a critical factor in designing feasible, high-performance controllers for the competition.
