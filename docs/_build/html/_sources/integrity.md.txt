# Integrity & Fairness

To ensure a fair and trustworthy competition, the WAPPAC platform is built on a foundation of standardization, security, and verification.

*   **Standardized Evaluation:** The WAPPAC application is a protected executable. This feature, together with the mandatory Evaluation Mode (`eval_flag=true`) guarantees a level playing field by assessing every participant against the exact same hydrodynamic model and deterministic sea states. This process generates secure, encrypted files to ensure the data is consistent and tamper-proof.


*   **Secure Execution:** Your script runs in a secure environment to prevent external interference (e.g., file access, networking). This guarantees identical runtime conditions for all and requires your controller to be self-contained within the `my_controller.py` file.


*   **Independent Verification:** To confirm the integrity of the final rankings, the organizers will re-run each submitted `my_controller.py` script on the official WAPPAC platform. This standard procedure verifies that all results are legitimate and reproducible.
