Showcase your results, example plots, or small tables here.

Example embedding of a static image placed into `_static/`:

```markdown
![Example spectrum](_static/example_spectrum.png)
```

If you later want interactive plots, you can embed Plotly/JS graphs by including the exported HTML snippet in a page or using embedded JS.
