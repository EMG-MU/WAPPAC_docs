## WAPPAC Competition

The WavePiston Passive Control (WAPPAC) competition is an open challenge offered to the wave energy and control community, where participants are invited to **design passive control strategies** for the novel WavePiston wave energy converter.
The goal is to **maximize captured energy while respecting WavePiston’s physical constraints**, with particular attention to the **PTO passivity constraint**, advancing the state of the art in wave energy control.

This competition is hosted by the **Centre for Ocean Energy Research (COER), Maynooth University**, and builds upon ongoing European research initiatives.

## WavePiston Device

[WavePiston](https://wavepiston.dk/) is a Danish wave energy technology developer, working to harness the vast potential of ocean waves.
Its system captures wave energy using a series of **sails and power take-off (PTO) units** mounted on a submerged string, converting wave motion into usable energy.

## EU Horizon SHY Project

WAPPAC is framed within the **EU Horizon Seawater HYdraulic (SHY) PTO project**, which develops key components of a seawater hydraulic PTO system and advanced control strategies for a novel wave energy converters.
The project aims to reduce the **levelized cost of energy (LCOE)** while minimizing environmental impact.

* **WavePiston**: Technology developer.
* **COER’s role**: Hydrodynamic modelling and control.
* **Key partners**: Technical University of Denmark, FibronPipe, Leser, Julia F. Chozas, Applied Renewables Research, Marine Systems Modelling, and PLOCAN.
