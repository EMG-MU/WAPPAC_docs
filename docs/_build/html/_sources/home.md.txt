## WAPPAC Competition

The **WavePiston Passive Control (WAPPAC) competition** is an open challenge to the wave energy and control community. Participants are invited to **develop passive control strategies** for the novel WavePiston wave energy converter (WEC).
The goal is to **maximize captured energy while respecting WavePiston physical constraints**, with particular attention to the **PTO passivity constraint**.

Through this initiative, WAPPAC competition aims to **foster innovation** and **advance** the **state of the art** in **wave energy control**. The WAPPAC competition results will be **announced** and **disseminated** through a **dedicated session** at an **international conference**.



This competition is hosted by the **Centre for Ocean Energy Research (COER), Maynooth University**, and is supported by the European Union (EU) under Horizon funding (Grant Agreement No. 101147456 - SHY).

## WavePiston Device

[**WavePiston**](https://wavepiston.dk/) is a Danish developer of innovative wave energy technology designed to harness the power of ocean waves.
The modular system captures energy through a series of **sails and power take-off (PTO) units** mounted along a submerged pipe or *string* (see {numref}`fig-wavepiston-1`). Each sail oscillates in response to the surge motion of incoming waves, and its horizontal movement relative to the string drives the hydraulic PTO units, converting the wave-induced motion into usable energy.

## EU Horizon [SHY](https://shyproject.eu/) Project

**WAPPAC** competition is framed within the EU's open science policy as part of the **EU Horizon** funded **Seawater HYdraulic (SHY) PTO project**. The SHY project aims to **reduce the levelized cost of energy (LCoE)** of the WavePiston device, while ensuring environmental sustainability, through the development of key components for a seawater-based hydraulic PTO system and the advancement of passive control strategies for wave energy converters.

* **WavePiston** – Technology developer and system integrator.
* **COER** – Responsible for control strategy development and various other research.
* **Key partners** – Technical University of Denmark, FibronPipe, Leser, Julia F. Chozas Consultancy, Applied Renewables Research, Marine Systems Modelling, and PLOCAN.
