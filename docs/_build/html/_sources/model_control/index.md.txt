# WavePiston Model & Control Framework

This section presents the **modeling framework** of the WavePiston device, the **formulation of the control problem**, its **numerical implementation**, and the **shared model parametrization** used in the competition. Its purpose is to provide participants with a consistent understanding of the physical system, control objectives, and computational setup.
