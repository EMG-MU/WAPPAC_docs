# 4.4 Running Simulations

There are two modes:

## Development Mode (`eval_flag = false`)

- Runs one simulation with your chosen `wave_id` and `wave_realiz_seed`.
- Produces:
  - `results.npz` → Arrays: `t`, `pos`, `vel`, `Fu`, `p_u`.
  - `results_metadata.json` → Performance summary (e.g., $\mathcal{G}$).
  - `results_visual.pdf` → Plots of position, velocity, control force, and power.

## Evaluation Mode (`eval_flag = true`)

- Runs **all three wave IDs** with fixed seeds.  
- Outputs encrypted `.enc` files to `evaluation_outputs/` folder.  
- These files are your **submission package**.  
- No access to raw time series or plots.  
- Terminal only prints whether **passivity constraint** was satisfied.
