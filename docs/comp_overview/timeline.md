## Competition Flow

The workflow for participants is straightforward:


1. **Develop** your controller locally using the WAPPAC simulation platform.  

2. **Test locally** with provided wave scenarios and tools.  

3. **Generate evaluation files**.  

4. **Submit** your controller, evaluation files and a report for official evaluation by the organizers.

5. results will be **announced** and **disseminated** through a dedicated session at an international conference.

The overall process ensures a **fair, repeatable, and secure evaluation** of all participants’ controllers.
